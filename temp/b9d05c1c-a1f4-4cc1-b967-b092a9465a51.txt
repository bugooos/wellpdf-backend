Nexu – Subdomain Intelligence & Recon Tool

What the tool does:

Nexu is a reconnaissance and intelligence tool for bug bounty hunters and penetration testers.

It helps users understand a target subdomain instead of just dumping scan results.

Current features:

- Finds subdomains for a target domain

- Shows which subdomains are alive

- Clicking a subdomain opens a detailed intelligence page

Subdomain intelligence includes:

- Core information (subdomain, IP address)

- DNS and network details (A, AAAA, CNAME, NS, MX, TXT records)

- HTTP behavior and response headers

- SSL / TLS certificate information

What makes Nexu different:

Instead of raw outputs, Nexu explains what the data means and why it matters.

Each section can be clicked to see explanations, risks, and next steps.

Future plans:

- Smart analyzers that detect real security risks

- Red flag system for potential misconfigurations

- Integrated tools like port scan, directory scan, dorking, and wayback URLs

- Guided hacking flow suggesting what to test next

Goal:

To help both beginners and experienced hunters think like professionals and focus on real attack
surfaces.
